# Toast-monitor
Initial Upload

This project uses Node-RED on a Raspberry Pi with a [SenseHAT](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/sense-hat/)to monitor Boston's [French Toast Alerting System](http://www.universalhub.com/french-toast?nocache=1) and the [DarkSky API](https://darksky.net/dev/) to provide a visual alert of any major weather incidents in the Boston area. 
The program is written in Node-RED using the standard nodes in the Raspbian install.
